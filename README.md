# Adaptive sampling and species detectability

We to investigate the influence of species detectability on the effect of adaptive sampling on the performance of species distribution models. This project will be an extension to the paper: https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/2041-210X.14355. The code is a cleaned version of the code found in this GitHub repository: https://github.com/BiologicalRecordsCentre/DECIDEWP1_simulation.
